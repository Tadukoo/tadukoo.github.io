blurb: Tadukoo Bible is a plugin for Bukkit that allows you to read the Bible through commands or give yourself the book(s).
summary: >
  Tadukoo Bible is a plugin for Bukkit that allows you to read the Bible through commands or get it in Minecraft books. One Minecraft book contains several chapters of 
  a book of the Bible, but Bible books are not mixed within Minecraft books (A new Bible book starts a new Minecraft book).

If you have a feature,command, or alias to suggest, please use either BukkitDev's Ticket System or GitHub's Issue Tracker and label it as an Enhancement.

## Known Issues
None at the moment.

If you find an error, please report it using either BukkitDev's Ticket System (label it as Defect) or GitHub's Issue Tracker (label it as Bug).

## Translations
Currently the only translation in the plugin is the King James Version (KJV), which is public domain. In the future, I will be requesting permission
for other translations, unless they are in public domain in which case I can use them without permission as well.

Feel free to suggest what the next translation I add should be.

## Installation
Unzip the TadukooBible.zip file.

Place the TadukooBible.jar file and the Tadukoo_Bible folder into your plugins folder.

**Note: The Tadukoo_Bible folder contains the Bible verses! The plugin does not generate these files as it would cause the first load time to take 
hours (literally)!**

Run your server and you should be good to go.

## Translation Progress
Note: Translations that are not 100%, but say "max" are completed up to the amount they have. For example, the Open English Bible does not have all of the 
books of the Bible in it yet, so it will not say 100%.

King James Version (KJV) (100%)

Open English Bible (OEB) (0%)
