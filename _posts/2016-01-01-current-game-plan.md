My current plan with my game (and beyond) is to get the API, Engine, and Game separation finished. That would get it to v.0.0.6.0. Also, then I would have an 
API and Engine upon which I can build various games.

My plan at that point is to make one simpler game (like maybe some Pacman-type game or something). Then I can use that simpler game as something to show people 
if they ever ask what I've made. Also I can finally say I made my own game from scratch (because the API, Engine, and Game itself would be my own making).

Ultimately with the API and Engine, I'd like to have them set-up so that I could make any program using them. So I could make a text editor if I wanted to, or 
a decoder for some code system I make up. I'd also like to eventually make a program that you can use to create programs from the engine and API. Like it gives 
you access to the API in order to use it correctly when developing your program, but the engine code is obfuscated at the time. Then when you decide to 
finalize your program, it pairs up the engine, API, and your game's code into a nice jar (or exe) file that runs the program you made.

One game from the past that I really want to make now is STSB (Super Tadukoo Smash Bros.). Basically the idea was that I'd make a game similar to Super Smash 
Bros. (hence the title), but with as many characters as I could think of to include. Basically the ultimate Super Smash Bros. that would include every 
character that I've ever heard of.

At that point, I had Game Maker, so I was actually trying to make the game. I believe I got it working for basic movement, a basic gun-type attack, and a 
health system (although I remember working with a percent system too). I had a few characters in it (basically just retextured though). The thing that I got 
stuck on was trying to make an unlockable character. I tried making Luigi unlockable, but it just wasn't working. Eventually I gave up. At this point, I have 
no idea where the code for that game is or if I even still have it.

But I have no idea if I'll ever make a game like that. One of the reasons I want to make another game before TAG is that TAG is this giant idea that will take 
a very long time to make, and I'd like to make some simpler game(s) before that. I don't think STSB is necessarily a simpler game, but I may end up trying to 
make it again. You never know. Perhaps the simpler game I make will be based off of a random title I make up as well, maybe for the acronym PEA this time?
