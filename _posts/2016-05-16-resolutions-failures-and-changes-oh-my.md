I posted <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-01-01-new-year-new-plans %}">here</a> before my New Year's Resolutions (well, some of them), and I'm 
here now to say: I haven't done them. At least not most of them. I haven't touched TAG since February, I haven't worked on other games or any Bukkit plugins 
at all, I didn't work on upcoming series for YouTube, there is no season 2 of either Minecraft with Tadukoo or Minecraft: Order of the Stone: A Retelling of 
the Cave Game, and I didn't make a compilation video for Minecraft with Tadukoo either.

What I did do, though, is finish out season 1 of both of those series. And that's it.

This post is to update the resolutions. So I'll be stating for each thing where I would be if I had stayed with the original resolution, and then an updated 
version (which can go into the next year if it needs to).

I've also realized that the resolutions I make should be updated more frequently. Because of this, I'll be keeping up-to-date resolutions on either my wiki 
or somewhere else. (I'll make a link here whenever I get that up).

<center><h3>Programming</h3></center>
<center><h4>TAG</h4></center>
By the plan, I'd be at v.0.0.7.0 with the game, meaning I'd have finished the API, Engine, and Game separation and I'd have the areas of the Prologue in the 
game (ability to move between them).

Instead, v.0.0.6.0 (API, Engine, Game separation) is planned to be finished by the end of June and v.0.0.7.0 (Prologue Area Completion) is planned to be 
finished by the end of July.

v.0.0.8.0 (Player Select Menu) is planned to be finished by the end of August.

v.0.0.9.0 (More Sounds) is planned to be finished as a portion of a Halloween update.

v.0.0.10.0 (Certain Animations) is planned to be finished as a portion of a Thanksgiving/Anniversary update.

v.0.0.11.0 (Debug Improvements) is planned to be finished as a portion of a Christmas update.

v.0.0.12.0 ("Hacking" Basics) is planned to be the first main goal of 2017, as long as the other updates come on time.

<center><h4>Other Games</h4></center>
I'd still like to make other games with the API and Engine from TAG, but I'm not sure when I'd like to do it (or when I can, if I wouldn't get there by the 
end of June).

<center><h4>Other</h4></center>
By the plan, I'd have made 2 updates to Tadukoo Bible already, but that hasn't happened.

Instead, I'll just try to do an update at the ends of June, August, October, and December to get version 1.1 out there.

Working on Tadukoo Perms is also planned, but the deadline for that is simply the end of the year.

<center><h3>YouTube</h3></center>
<center><h4>Current Series</h4></center>
Minecraft with Tadukoo: I finished season 1 as planned, but I'd have made a compilation video and started a 2nd season. Instead, it'll be on hiatus until at 
least the beginning of June, possibly mid-June or early July. The compilation video will come before the 2nd season starts.

Minecraft: Order of the Stone: A Retelling of the Cave Game: Season 1 finished as planned. Season 2 is still planned to at least be recorded this year, if 
not uploaded this year.

Song Time: Nothing specified previously, currently want to make "behind the scenes" for season 1, but I'm not sure if I want to this year.

<center><h4>Upcoming Series</h4></center>
Tadukoo's Tale: Specified to start sometime this year. I may record more this year, but I'm thinking New Year's 2017 would be the earliest I would start 
uploading it.

TAG: I wanted to record episodes of me showing my progress on this. I'm not sure if I'm able to record now, but I know there are resolution issues with my 
desktop, and that my laptop probably can't. Hopefully by v.0.0.6.0 or v.0.0.7.0, I'll be able to record it.

Drawn to Life: Previous specified as a hope. Not sure if I'll get to it this year.

Proving Creation: Specified it would start in the summer or later. Currently planning to start working on it tomorrow.

Other Series: None planned previously. Other Christian series currently planned to start working on this month.
