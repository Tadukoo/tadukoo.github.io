Just as a note before we get started, I always have to type and delete "so" at the beginning of every blog. "So" is my go-to word to start a sentence after 
thinking about it for a bit. If you see the word "so", I probably thought about that part of the post for a while.

Anyway, [last post]({% post_url 2016-05-16-resolutions-failures-and-changes-oh-my %}) I talked about the resolutions I made at 
the start of the year and the updates to them. There's just one thing I forgot.

I forgot about the separation of API, Engine, and Game leading to the possibility to create more games and programs easily and that I wanted to make new 
games and programs in order to improve the API and Engine. That's why in the [original resolution]({% post_url 2016-01-01-new-year-new-plans %}), 
I had the section to create two games using the API and Engine. In the current one, I simply said I'd like to make games, but I'm not sure when.

The reason I'm bringing this up now is that I've been inspired by 
<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/maps/2231637-beta-minevolution-a-minecraft-incrementation-game">Minevolution</a> (a 
minecraft cookie clicker-type map), the Upgrade Complete games, and Tangerine Tycoon on Kongregate.

Essentially what I see with them is a combination of games (like Upgrade Complete is a combination of an upgrading game (e.g. Learn to Fly) and an 
arcade-style game).

So essentially I want to make a game that is a combination of several games. How it turns out, I have no idea at this point.

One of the things I had in mind to make with the API and Engine was tic-tac-toe, simply as something simple to do to test that I can make other games. Now 
I've been inspired by Strategic Tic-Tac-Toe on Kongregate to make an even bigger version of that, but that you finish a smaller board before moving on to the 
next one.

So now you see that I essentially have two games planned, but now that I think about it, it'd probably be better to make the games to run on Kongregate so I 
could earn money on them easily, but I'm not sure what I'll do at this point.

Right now, I'm not even sure when I'll finish the API, Engine, and Game separation to be able to tell when I could use it.
