Just like <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-01-01-new-year-new-plans %}">last year</a>, I have new plans with the coming of the New Year. This year, 
I won't be posting the new plans in the same format as last year (because frankly it was a terrible format, but to be fair it made sense for the amount of plans).

One thing I want to do is to start following a yearly Bible reading plan (specifically 
<a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-reading-plan/one-year-immersion-plan.html">this one on Bible Gateway</a>). It is designed for you to read the Old 
Testament once and the New Testament 3 times in a year.

Another thing I'll be doing is following the 30 Days of Hustle by Jon Acuff for January. My current idea for what to hustle on with it is writing a book 
discussing various arguments for the existence of God, what atheists have to say about the arguments, and responses to the atheists. Whether that's what I 
actually do for the 30 days or not, we'll see.

For YouTube, I'm planning to switch to a twice a week upload schedule, uploading a Minecraft w/ 3/2 Blockheads episode every Thursday and another video every 
Tuesday. Currently the Tuesday slot is planned to include previously unused clips or videos, highlight videos for Minecraft with Tadukoo, and other pretty 
random stuff. Eventually it'll be changed to a regular series, but that's what I'll use it for until I decide what series to put in that slot.

For this blog, I'd like to continue the weekly posting I've done for the past month or so. I'd also like to get into having more posts that aren't planned and 
are more spontaneous (e.g. I make a post one day about something I read or have been working on and it's outside of the weekly schedule).
