For now with the blog, I'm going to limit myself to two posts a day, other than blog updates like this one. I'm also going to try starting tomorrow to spread 
the posts out more so that it's not one post right after another.

This way, the blog doesn't just explode at the beginning and die down in a few days. Right now I do have a lot to talk about, since I've never really talked 
about the game or anything outside of a couple friends. Also, I've been working on the game a lot recently, trying to make the API and Engine. So this should 
be the last post today.
