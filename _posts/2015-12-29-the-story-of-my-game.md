There's a game I've been working on for over a year now. It originally started out as a joke, but then became an actual game, although it is very early in 
development. This post is about how the game started.

A long time ago, I found OHRRPGCE online (an RPG maker), and I started making games with it. None of them got very far at all. My plan back then was to make 
7 games based off a world I imagined where they spread across the history of that universe. For some of the games, I made the titles parodies of Mario game 
titles. For example, the 6th game was "Tadukoo 64" and the 7th was "Tadukoo Party 7".

Back on November 25th of last year, I remembered that I had plans for making those games, and I joked with a friend about what the names may have been 
(because at the time I didn't know where I had put the papers with the information about them). At first, I joked using names of games I could think of, but 
I opened a list of Mario games and started basically just replacing "Mario" (or other characters) with "Tadukoo" in the titles. One interesting title I said 
was "Super Princess Tadukoo".

Eventually, I saw "Mario and Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games" and changed it to "Tadukoo and Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games". I 
joked from this that the first game I actually make and finish would have an extremely long title.

I joked that the abbreviation of the game could be "T.A.D.U.K.O.O. I.S. T.H.E. G.R.E.A.T.E.S.T. P.E.R.S.O.N. W.H.O. E.V.E.R. L.I.V.E.D." and began to joke 
about what the full title would be. I started with "Tadukoo's Adventure" and ended up eventually going with "Tadukoo's Adventure During Uncontrollable Knee 
Oscillations Over Internet Systems That Have Everlasting Genies Resisting Every Animal That Eats Something That People of Earth Rent Sometimes Only on 
November Wednesdays, However, Oranges Eat Violins Evolving while Revolving Literal Integers Vividly Envelope the Darkness."

From there, I joked about what the title means and how it could be incorporated into the gameplay. I kept joking about it on and off for the rest of the 
day and the next morning. That morning, I decided to start actually making it into a game.

The basic plot to the game is that Tadukoo (the player) watches a weird video online that causes knee spasms. He decides to get revenge on the channel the 
only way he knows how: going into the internet and deleting the channel from there. He looks up how to get into the internet, and after scrolling through 
tutorials on opening Internet Explorer, he finds that a server building is nearby. He goes into the city and finds that the internet is leaking into real 
life, and he runs into a group of scientists trying to fix the problem by going into the internet. These scientists cannot complete their mission due to the 
leaking internet overtaking them, so Tadukoo decides to fix that problem as well on his journey.

Sometime soon, I'll be posting about the development of the game and the current status of it.
