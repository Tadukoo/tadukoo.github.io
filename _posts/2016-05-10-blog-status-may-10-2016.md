As you can see, I've been making about one post a month. I didn't really plan that, it just sort of happened. I remember back in December and January, I 
thought I'd be making two posts a day every day. Of course that hasn't happened, due to college and work taking a lot of time out of me.

There's a lot I could talk about on here, but I never get around to it. For me, my last day of college this semester is Thursday. So now that I'll have more 
time, I'd like to make a post at least every other week, but preferably every week (or more frequently). I'm afraid that making one more than once a week 
would lead to me thinking I have nothing more to say (regardless of how false that is). So expect a post later today (possibly in the next hour), and then 
one two weeks from today.
